# Howl Language Semantic Analysis Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the semantic analysis system implemented for the Howl programming language, which provides compile-time type checking, type inference, and advanced type system features similar to Zig.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Extended Type System
- **Primitive Types**: Added `type` primitive for compile-time type manipulation
- **Compile-time Types**: `comptime_type` for types evaluated at compile time  
- **Custom Structs**: `custom_struct` for user-defined struct types
- **Type Compatibility**: Enhanced type checking with custom type support

### 2. AST Extensions
- **Struct Declarations**: `struct_decl` nodes for struct definitions
- **Type Declarations**: `type_decl` nodes for type aliases
- **Type Expressions**: `type_expr` and `struct_type_expr` for compile-time type creation
- **Enhanced Symbols**: Extended symbol types to support struct and type definitions

### 3. Compile-time Value System
- **ComptimeValue Union**: Support for type values, integers, floats, booleans, strings, and struct types
- **Type Conversion**: Methods to convert between compile-time values and types
- **Compile-time Evaluation**: Infrastructure for evaluating expressions at compile time

### 4. Enhanced Semantic Analyzer
- **Symbol Management**: Extended symbol tracking with new symbol types
- **Type Registry**: Storage for user-defined types and struct definitions  
- **Member Access**: Validation for struct member access
- **Comprehensive Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages with source locations

## Howl Language Syntax Support

The parser already supports key Howl syntax constructs:

### Function Declarations
```howl
pub greet :: fn(name: string) string {
    return "Hello, " + name
}
```

### Constants and Variables
```howl
name :: "Howl Language"        // Constant with type inference
count: i32 :: 42              // Type-annotated constant
```

### Struct Definitions (Designed)
```howl
Point :: struct {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

### Type Aliases (Designed)
```howl
Coordinate :: i32
Vector :: Point
```

## Semantic Analysis Capabilities

### 1. Type Inference
- Automatic type inference for constants and variables
- Function return type inference
- Expression type checking

### 2. Type Checking
- Variable assignment compatibility
- Function parameter and return type validation
- Binary and unary operation type checking
- Member access validation for structs

### 3. Symbol Resolution
- Variable and function lookup with scope management
- Duplicate declaration detection
- Unused variable warnings
- Type name resolution

### 4. Error Recovery
- Comprehensive error reporting with precise source locations
- Intelligent error messages with suggestions
- Graceful handling of type mismatches and undefined symbols

## Integration Status

### âœ… Completed
- AST type system extensions
- Semantic analyzer core infrastructure
- Type inference and checking algorithms
- Symbol management system
- Error reporting integration
- Parser support for basic Howl syntax (::, functions, constants)

### ðŸš§ In Progress

- Struct declaration parsing
- Complete compile-time evaluation system

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Generic type system
- Advanced metaprogramming features
- Module system integration
- Optimization passes

## Example Programs

The implementation supports analysis of Howl programs like:

```howl
// Basic type inference and function calls
add :: fn(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {
    return a + b
}

result :: add(5, 10)  // Inferred as i32

// Future: Compile-time type creation
PointType :: struct {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

origin :: PointType { x: 0, y: 0 }
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Memory Management
- Arena-based AST allocation for efficient memory usage
- HashMap-based type and symbol registries
- Scope-based symbol management with proper cleanup

### Error System Integration
- Seamless integration with existing error reporting system
- Source location tracking for precise error reporting
- Structured error codes with semantic categories

### Extensibility
- Modular design allows easy addition of new type features
- Plugin-friendly architecture for custom type checking
- Clean separation between parsing, semantic analysis, and codegen

## Technical Implementation

### Key Data Structures
- `SemanticAnalyzer`: Main analysis coordinator
- `Symbol`: Variable, function, and type information
- `Scope`: Hierarchical symbol management
- `ComptimeValue`: Compile-time value representation
- `Type`: Extended type system with custom types

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Symbol Declaration**: Register variables, functions, and types
2. **Type Inference**: Determine types for expressions and variables  
3. **Type Checking**: Validate type compatibility and constraints
4. **Member Resolution**: Resolve struct member access
5. **Error Reporting**: Generate comprehensive error messages

This semantic analysis system provides a solid foundation for Howl's type system and enables advanced compile-time features similar to those found in Zig and other modern systems programming languages.
