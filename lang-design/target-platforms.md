# Target Plaftforms

For now: `ecmascript` better known as `javascript`. In a later stage the goal is to also target `zig`  
intermediate representation or zig's AST.

## Runtime

Likely the current design needs a bit of a runtime (at least for EcmaScript). And maybe for all targets
if we want threading support.

## Ecmascript / JS

For a relatively simple target.
